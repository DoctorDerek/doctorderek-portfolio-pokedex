# 🃏 Pokédex - Next.js 12 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS + XState + Mock Login

# 👀 View Production Build at https://pokedex-doctorderek.vercel.app/

I built a Pokédex that queries a GraphQL endpoint at https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/

Additionally, I added 3 other major features, including best practices and XState for mock login (admin/admin).

Below you will find the complete feature set, a discussion section, and my technical journal.

## Required Features

1. ✅ Ability to create forms
2. ✅ Ability to implement the various form states (field validation, error, success etc)
3. ✅ Ability to implement style to spec
4. ✅ Responsiveness
5. ✅ Ability to use Graphql correctly
6. ✅ Ability to integrate a real API
7. ✅ Ability to implement a pagination API
8. ✅ Clean-code and separation of component concerns
9. ✅ Ability to design new UIs

## Additional Features

### ✅ === DONE

### 🌠 === TODO

1. ✅ Deployed production build of Next.js to Vercel with CI/CD
2. ✅ Used Next.js version 12.1.6 with React 18.1.0 and Tailwind CSS 3.0.24
3. ✅ Established engineering best practices:
   - Prettier, ESLint, Husky (Git Hooks), `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript Import Sorter, XState
4. 🌠 Crafted unit tests for new code features (TDD / Test Driven Development)
   - Jest + React Testing Library with React Test Renderer
5. 🌠 Wrote unit testing (100% test coverage)
6. 🌠 Developed mobile-first, responsive UX design with Tailwind CSS
7. 🌠 Implemented Tailwind CSS dark mode for app with animated SVG toggle

## Discussion Section

1. The feature set is complete, but the app could use additional features and testing.
2. I wrote the login feature to save the authenticated user to localStorage via XState.
3. There are optimizations possible for the pagination and data-fetching algorithms.
4. Overall the app's performance is good because of Next.js SSR + use of next/image.

## Local Development

To run the project locally, please use `pnpm`:

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
